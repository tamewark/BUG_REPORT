BUG Title: Chat is missing on the creator side, and recent and read filters are not working.


BUG Found: On 17 January, for one creator who has approximately 900 followers, the chat was not loading. The admin panel was also taking a long time to load. By Monday, around 50% of creators chats were not loading, and the API was returning a 504 Gateway Timeout error.

Root Cause: 
The server was under attack, causing abnormal load.


A load average of 18.87 indicates severe server stress (normal load should be below 2.0).


Multiple processes were consuming approximately 30.1% CPU each, leading to performance degradation.


As a result, it was necessary to increase CPU capacity to stabilize the system
How to Solve / Proposed Solution:
Deepika temporarily reduced the API response load to minimize server stress.


The server CPU size was increased to handle higher processing demands.


After these changes, the issue was resolved and system performance stabilized.
Solved: 19 Jan and 20 Jan 2025
