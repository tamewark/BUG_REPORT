BUG Title: Some creators’ chats are not showing in the chat list.
BUG Found : At 4:45 PM, some creators’ chats started showing a 500 Internal Server Error automatically.
Root Cause:The chat API returned 500 errors only for certain users because replica set instability can cause inconsistent read/write routing. Requests for some users were hitting a node with stale data, delayed replication, or connectivity issues, while others were routed to a healthy primary node.
High-traffic, user-specific queries (like chat and chat search) are more sensitive to such inconsistencies, which is why the issue appeared selectively rather than for all users.


How to Solve/Proposed Solution:
Since zero downtime was required, the database migration was attempted using a MongoDB replica set. This involved changes to network security, firewall rules, and MongoDB configuration so both servers could communicate over IPs.
The replica set approach did not work as expected and caused unintended MongoDB configuration issues. As a result, high-traffic APIs like chat and chat search started returning unexpected 500 errors without any code changes.
Once the database was fully moved to the new server and the replica set configuration was removed, the APIs immediately started working normally.
